### What is this?
**Vibe-Check** (also known as VIBE OS) is an intelligent tool that scans photos or videos of streets and neighborhoods to understand their "culture." 

It uses Google's Gemini AI to look at a scene like a human anthropologist would, noticing small details about fashion, architecture, and atmosphere that others might miss.

### What is it used for?

*   **Analyzing Neighborhoods:** Instantly understand if a place is "cool," "corporate," "touristy," or "up-and-coming."
*   **Business Strategy:** It automatically suggests what kind of business would succeed in that specific spot (e.g., a "Natural Wine Bar" or a "Tech Coworking Space").
*   **Real Estate Intel:** It estimates rent prices, vacancy risks, and gentrification levels based on visual cues.
*   **Cultural Insights:** It identifies who lives there (personas), what they wear (local uniform), and even what music fits the mood.

### Key Features

*   **The Latte Index:** Estimates the price of a coffee based on the neighborhood vibe.
*   **Instant IPO:** Generates a logo and marketing slogan for a business that fits the location.
*   **Gentrification Score:** Measures how fast a neighborhood is changing.
*   **Visual Grounding:** Draws boxes around objects it sees (like "Artisan Coffee" or "Vintage Cyclist") to explain its reasoning.
*   **Vibe Tarot:** Assigns a mystical card to the location's energy.

### How to use it
1.  Open the app.
2.  Enter your Gemini API Key.
3.  Upload an image or video of a street.
4.  Watch the AI decode the location in real-time.
